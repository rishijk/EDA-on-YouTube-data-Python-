# YouTube Trending Videos: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview

In November 2021, YouTube announced its decision to hide the public dislike count. However, until December 13, 2021, the official YouTube Data API still provided access to dislike counts. This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on trending YouTube videos from August 2020 to December 2021 across the USA, Canada, and Great Britain. By leveraging Python's powerful data analysis libraries, we uncover trends in likes, dislikes, and audience engagement.

🔍 Domain: Social Media

This project focuses on analyzing audience engagement metrics to gain insights into the impact of YouTube's decision and help content creators optimize their strategies.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

NumPy – Numerical computations

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis
